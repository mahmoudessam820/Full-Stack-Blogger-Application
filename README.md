###   Vue

Vue is a progressive open-source JavaScript framework for building UI,
the word "progressive" means its implemented as additional markup to html. it basically a template model bound to a data model.

### FLASK

Flask is a Python microframework like Pyramid, bottle or cherrypy, and with it we'll build a a RESTful API today, I also have a tutorial to show you how to create a restful API in Flask in two different ways. And I have a crash course on Flask, you can check it out if you like.
